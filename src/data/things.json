The first (topped by a silver ring) pulls open a void in space like a wound canvas, which acts as a window to the pocket dimension where the items are stored. The second (topped by a golden ring) opens a window to the dimension but also forcibly ejects the contents of the Vault into the surrounding space. The Vault also has a unique property to store Tiny living creatures in stasis indefinitely, without any adverse effects."
